When your assignment is complete, please answer the questions in this text file and upload it to I-Learn.


1. Please describe your experiment/results for the Vowel dataset. How many different parameters did you try? What was the highest accuracy you obtained, and what were the parameters that produced it?

I tried 12 differnt combinations of parameters, utilising all 4 kernals functions. The highest accuracy was 0.9959514 with gamma = 0.1, cost = 5, radial Kernal function.
the dataset reponded poorly to sigmoid function, lowest accuracy reaching 0.1214575.

2. Please describe your experiment/results for the Letters dataset. How many different parameters did you try? What was the highest accuracy you obtained, and what were the parameters that produced it?


I tried 12 differnt combinations of parameters, also utilising all 4 kernals functions. The highest accuracy was 0.9736 with gamma = 0.1, cost = 5, radial Kernal function.
it seems like this setting works the best for both datasets.
the dataset also reponded poorly to sigmoid function, lowest accuracy reaching 0.3318


3. Describe anything you did to go above and beyond the minimum standard requirements.

I built a function that will take the dataset and according to the parameters I pass in, it will split the data and retrun the accuracy of the test data.

4. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements


5. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I met all the requirements and simplified the steps for testing different parameters, I also did moire than 10 combination of testing for each data set.
